Your goal today is to build a "Chose your own adventure game". Using what you have learnt in the lessons today you will be building a very simple version of this type of text game.

- Use the flow chart linked here to create the game logic.

Once you've completed the project, you can always extend the game and make it more interesting!

# To play the game:
```python
    cd 100-days-of-python/beginner/day_03/treasure_island
```

```python
    python3 main.py
```
